11,skincareaddiction,[B&A] I‚Äôm so happy right now,10586,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/13kszcr,"I apologise for the difference in lighting. The first picture was taken in January 2020, at my dermatologist‚Äôs clinic after a brutal extraction. I think every pore in my face were filled with cysts and comedones, I was so hopelessly lost.

Three years later, my skin is almost clear‚Äî I still get spots on my chin sometimes, though. I used to scoff at people who say ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù but I can‚Äôt believe it actually happened to me.

Believe it or not, accutane/isotretinoin wasn‚Äôt involved because my liver is too weak to handle it. Instead, I was given combination birth control for my PCOS by my OB. My derm didn‚Äôt prescribe antibiotics, but gave me oral supplements like glutathione, 1000 mg vitamin C, and 150mg zinc.

Here‚Äôs my skincare routine for anyone interested:

However, I changed my sunscreen to Elta MD UV clear around 2 weeks ago. My skin has been loving it and it feels more ‚Äúelegant‚Äù (idk the exact term) than the LRP one.

EDIT: Microneedling and CO2 laser were done after my pimples were gone. These took care of the scars. I think they worked really well, because right after my pimples healed, they were done immediately to me‚Äî giving no chance for scars to form.

EDIT 2: For some reason, my edits also keep becoming replies so I have to delete them. Idk why.",1690

There‚Äôs nothing crazy in there but i figured I‚Äôd let you know in case you didn‚Äôt intend to show them.",658

It is  reaclly nice seeimg Celebs without layers of Filters as a nice reminder that even they don't have poreless, always marble smooth skin.

Fine lines, textures and so on are not really flaws IMO but for those of you guys who are tackling these concerns in your routines be proud of your progress wherever you are with it. Almost everyone has them (rich or poor) and they don't take aways from you looking yout best.",540
